First, we download all genomes with more than 100 closed genome assemblies, and then we search for those with reads. 

Then, we search for phage sequences with genomad, and we classify the phages as virulent or temperate with Bacphlip


*Genomad = 3893 assemblies with 4572 phages*
*Assemblies without phages based on Genomad: 705*


*Bacphlip assemblies with phages = 3893 and 3966 phages*
*After filtering by low % of the type: 3816 assemblies and 3885 phages*
