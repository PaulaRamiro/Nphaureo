### Questions that we want to explore:


  - Numero pHAUREO -> ¿exist?
  - Plasmid–phage abundance and size relationships
  - Correlation between plasmid load and phage load per genome: do genomes with more plasmids also carry more phages (temperate or virulent)?
  - Compare the proportion of the genome occupied by plasmids vs phages.
  - Chromosome size vs mobile element load: are larger chromosomes more permissive to plasmids and phages?
  - Co-occurrence: Do genomes carrying certain plasmid types host fewer/more phages? (type of mobility/replicon type)
  - Relative size scaling: is plasmid size correlated with phage size, suggesting competition for cellular resources?

Defensive plasmid hypothesis: test whether genomes with plasmids carry fewer virulent phages (plasmids as infection barriers).



## Filtering the data

First, we download all genomes with more than 100 closed genome assemblies, and then we search for those with reads. 

Then, we search for phage sequences with genomad, and we classify the phages as virulent or temperate with Bacphlip


*Genomad = 3893 assemblies with 4572 phages*
*Assemblies without phages based on Genomad: 705*


*Bacphlip assemblies with phages = 3893 and 3966 phages*
*After filtering by low % of the type: 3816 assemblies and 3885 phages*
